                <p>
                    In this site is to teach ASL (American Sign Language) to people in the five boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx and Staten Island). My website will help people to accomplish the basic skills of ASL to communicate with the deaf community.My intended audience will be deaf and hard of hearing adults and children and their hearing parents/guardians. <P>There is a huge untap opportunity in this field. Only a few people are teaching ASL and want to reach out to communicate with the deaf community. The problem encounter will be getting people out in these boroughs to start this program and issues such as a limited time frame in which to learn ASL.</P>
                </p>
                <p>
               I will be targeting the deaf children in all the school in the five boroughs in New York City through flyers, School base Visits, Websites and doing frequent workshop on sites. My program will include home base and center base classes for anyone.There is a great potential in this business as there are few people who can communicate in ASL. This can be useful asset in any job for anyone meaning normal hearing and deaf or Hard of Hearing individuals. It is never too late to learn Sign Language and to provide help to the deaf Community. In a basic class youâ€™ll find a new approach to learning ASL this course teaches shapes, numbers, the alphabet, and intro dictionary level conversation to enhance your ability to build upon the language. The goal is that ASL classes is to get you off the page and signing confidentiality in the language.
